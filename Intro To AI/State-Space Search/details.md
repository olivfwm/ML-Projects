This assignment was one of the assignments done in the **Intro to AI** course I took at UW.

In this assignment, I studied state-space search in single-agent, deterministic environments, heuristic search 
through different search methods and on different problems, such as the Human Robot Ferry, Towers of Hanoi, Farmer Fox, etc.

AStar.py - A* search

ItrBFS.py - Breadth first search

ItrDFS.py - Depth first search

UCS.py - Uniform cost search

Farmer_Fox.py - Represents the farmer fox problem and uses a search to find the solution.

All search files shows the **partial** code implemented.
