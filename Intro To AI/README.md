# CSE 415 Intro To AI

This course focused on principles and programming techniques of artificial intelligence: LISP, symbol manipulation, knowledge representation, logical and probabilistic reasoning, learning, language understanding, vision, expert systems, and social issues.

There are many assignments we completed during the duration of the course, I have only included the major ones.

Much of the python files only shows partial code, as this portfolio is public, so those code were covered for academic integrity.

All assignments were done individually, so all work have been contributed by me

Below is a general outline, for more detailed description of each project, please check the README.md files in the individual project pages.


## Adverarial Search

Artificial intelligence agent capable of playing the game "K-in-a-Row with Forbidden Squares". My implementation was focused on crafting a MinimaxAgent, housed within a single Python file named minimax_agent.py. This agent was designed to optimize its performance in the game through a minimax algorithm that searches through all possible moves and consider the consequences, with enhancements for efficiency.

## State-Space Search

Focused on implementing state-space search strategies in deterministic single-agent environments. This assignment explored both blind and heuristic search strategies, using classic problems like the Farmer, Fox, Chicken, and Grain puzzle and the Towers of Hanoi to apply these methods.

## Reinforcement Learning

Practical applications of value iteration and Q-learning in reinforcement learning within a defined Markov Decision Process (MDP), specifically using a "Towers-of-Hanoi World" (TOH World) as the environment.

## Perceptron Learning

Implementing the perceptron linear classifiers by hand, understanding from base code the fundamentals of perceptron learning. Then using the algorithms implemented, attempted to classify the Iris dataset in two different contexts. 

## Learning Outcome

- Understanding of AI algorithms from the coding process instead of just using pre-written packages
- Hands on code experience from implementation, debugging, and application to actual problems
- Compete against other classmates for chance of improvements in efficiency of algorithms
- Object-oriented programming with python
