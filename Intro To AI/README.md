# CSE 415 Intro To AI

This course focused on principles and programming techniques of artificial intelligence: LISP, symbol manipulation, knowledge representation, logical and probabilistic reasoning, learning, language understanding, vision, expert systems, and social issues.

There are many assignments we completed during the duration of the course, I have only included the major ones.

Much of the python files only shows partial code, as this portfolio is public, so those code were covered for academic integrity.

All assignments were done individually, so all work have been contributed by me

## Adverarial Search

In this assignment, I created a program that implements an agent that can participate in a game of K-in-a-Row with Forbidden Squares (defined distinctively for each game). Then the agent's performance is demonstrated through a game transcript of the agent playing against another agent. The strategy used here is minimax search.

The minimax_agent.py shows the partial code implemented for agent.
The out.pdf file shows the transcript of a game with another agent.

Out of 20 submissions among our class, I won 7th place.
