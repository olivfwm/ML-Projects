This assignment was one of the assignments done in the **Intro to AI** course I took at UW.

In this assignment, I created a program that implements an agent that can participate in a game of K-in-a-Row with Forbidden Squares (defined distinctively for each game). Then the agent's performance is demonstrated through a game transcript of the agent playing against another agent. The strategy used here is minimax search. 

The *minimax_agent.py* shows the python code implemented for agent.

The *out.pdf* file shows the transcript of a game with another agent.

Out of 20 submissions among our class, I won 7th place.
