## Files and their contents

- The *minimax_agent.py* shows the **partial** code implemented for agent.
  - Initialization and Setup
  - Agent Introduction
  - Move Selection: Implements the choose_move function, which selects the optimal move based on the current state of the game within a specified time limit.
  - Minimax Algorithm: Contains the minimax function that recursively evaluates potential moves to determine the best possible outcome, using depth-limited search and optional enhancements like alpha-beta pruning for efficiency.
  - Static Evaluation: The static_eval function assesses the value of different game states, helping the agent to recognize favorable or unfavorable conditions.
- The *out.pdf* file shows the transcript of a game with another agent.
- Out of 20 submissions among our class, I won 7th place.
