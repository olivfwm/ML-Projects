This assignment is about how perceptrons are trained, and it involves training and testing to perform classification of data into categories.

We'll consider a 2-class classification problem, and implement a very basic binary classifier and the standard perceptron learning algorithm. As part of the assignment, there is a report with answers to questions based on the code I implement, as well as what happens when I run the code.
