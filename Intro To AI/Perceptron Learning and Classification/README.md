- binary_perceptron.py
  - the main implementation of the binary classifier
  - perceptron learning algorithm, which adjusts weights based on training data to classify data points into two categories
- run_ring_data.py
  - applies the binary perceptron model to the ring-data.csv dataset.
  - includes a class (PlotRingBP) that uses the PlotBinaryPerceptron approach for visualizing how the perceptron learns to classify this dataset
