# Statistics Final Projects

This folder contains final projects for some of my statistics classes.

## IMDb Movies Trend Analysis

**Background**

This project was done for Stat 498 Agile Data Science, where I worked in a team of four.

Our task was to build some dashboard, visualization report, models, or other forms that analyzes the data and presents the findings to the class. The topic and data were of our choice, and we chose to analyze the data provided by IMDb on the audience's favor trend over the timeframe recorded by the data.

The data can be found here: https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/
