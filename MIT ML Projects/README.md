# Data Science and Machine Learning Certificate Program @ MIT Great Learning

This folder contains specifically some most representative projects done learning with the program.

## Projects

### Case_Study_Notebook.ipynb (deep learning)

- Given a dataset with current credentials, demographics, and work experience related data, conduct HR research on factors that influence people leave their job
- building a neural network model that predicts the probability that a candidate is looking for a new job, as well as interpret the main factors that affect an employee's decision whether to continue or attrite
-
