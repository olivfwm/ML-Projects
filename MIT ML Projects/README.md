# Data Science and Machine Learning Certificate Program @ MIT Great Learning

This folder contains specifically some most representative projects done learning with the program.

PDF version of the completion certificate is also included.

## Projects

### Case_Study_Notebook.ipynb (deep learning)

- Given a dataset with current credentials, demographics, and work experience related data, conduct HR research on factors that influence people leave their job
- building a neural network model that predicts the probability that a candidate is looking for a new job, as well as interpret the main factors that affect an employee's decision whether to continue or attrite
- Start with understanding the data, conducting exploratory data analysis to make decisions for later processes, data cleaning, building models, hyperparameter tuning, and last but not least, make interpretations and recommendations

### Potential-Customers-Prediction.ipynb (decision tree)

- The company in this scenario wants to understand how to better attract potential customers
- Building decision tree models, visualizing the tree, tuning the tree and as well as understanding the reasons behind each tuning
- In depth exploratory data analysis, data cleaning
- Make interpretations and recommendations from the decision tree result

### Recommendation_Systems_Learner_Notebook_Full_Code.ipynb
