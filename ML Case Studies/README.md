# Data Science and Machine Learning Certificate Program @ MIT Great Learning

This folder contains specifically some most representative projects done learning with the program.

PDF version of the completion certificate is also included.

## Projects

### Case_Study_Notebook.ipynb (deep learning)

- Given a dataset with current credentials, demographics, and work experience related data, conduct HR research on factors that influence people leave their job
- building a neural network model that predicts the probability that a candidate is looking for a new job, as well as interpret the main factors that affect an employee's decision whether to continue or attrite
- Start with understanding the data, conducting exploratory data analysis to make decisions for later processes, data cleaning, building models, hyperparameter tuning, and last but not least, make interpretations and recommendations

### Potential-Customers-Prediction.ipynb (decision tree)

- The company in this scenario wants to understand how to better attract potential customers
- Building decision tree models, visualizing the tree, tuning the tree and as well as understanding the reasons behind each tuning
- In depth exploratory data analysis, data cleaning
- Make interpretations and recommendations from the decision tree result

### Recommendation_Systems_Learner_Notebook_Full_Code.ipynb

- Working with Amazon product reviews dataset that contains ratings of different electronic products
- Take the role as Data Science Manager at Amazon to build a recommendation system to recommend products to customers based on their previous ratings for other products
- As all projects, understand data through EDA and perform data cleaning
- Build three different types of recommendation models, such as user-user based, item-item based, and model based
- Give recommendations to user using different models
- Evaluate with different metrics



## About the program

Composed of several units listed below. Each unit contains lecture videos, checkpoints, mentoring session, master session, and final project for certain units.

#### Making sense of unstructured data

- K-Means Clustering
- PCA and dimensionality reduction

#### Regression
- Linear and non-linear regression methods
- Validify models
- Evaluation metrics
- Regularization

#### Classification
- Apply hypothesis testing
- Tree-based algorithms
- Ensemble methods

#### Deep Learning
- Intuition behind deep learning and non-linear mapping output
- Gradients, back-propagation
- TenserFlow/Keras usage
- Basic training algorithms

#### Recommender Systems
- Intuition and process

- Collaborative filtering



## Learning outcome

This is my first time being exposed to machine learning concepts, as well as the first time I was officially taught with Python. From this program, I was really able to get tons of practice with data analysis and visualization, as it was required for every big or small assignments, before continuing to the machine learning parts. 

I was also well introduced to the majority different topics in machine learning, and getting a good practice with each of those. The lectures and checkpoints ensured I understood the concepts, and the projects made sure I know how to apply these techniques to actual data.

Taking this course really allowed to feel like if I were given some data, I know what I can try to do with it. It also gave me a headstart for other courses that are related to python and machine learning, allowing me to be able to learn deeper concepts without being left behind.
