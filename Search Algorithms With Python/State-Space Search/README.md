## Files and their contents

*Note*: These are not the only files to achieve the expected outcomes

- Farmer_Fox.py
  - implementation of the problem formulation for the "Farmer, Fox, Chicken, and Grain" problem, a classic river crossing puzzle.
  - define the state space, the initial state, goal state, and the valid moves (actions) within this problem domain, which the AI needs to solve through search algorithms.

- ItrDFS.py
  - implements an iterative deepening depth-first search (DFS) algorithm
  - test the search algorithm's efficiency and correctness in navigating through the state space defined in the problem formulations like the "Farmer, Fox, Chicken, and Grain" problem
    
- ItrBFS.py
  - contains implementation of the iterative breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm
  - essential for exploring the breadth of the state space efficiently and is used to compare the performance and suitability of BFS in contrast to DFS for the problems provided
    
- BlindSearches.pdf
  - report that includes findings from running DFS and BFS on various problems
  - contains tables or charts comparing the performance of these searches, such as path lengths, number of nodes expanded, and computational resources used
 
- FFCG-log.txt
  - log file records the outputs from running search algorithms on the "Farmer, Fox, Chicken, and Grain" problem
