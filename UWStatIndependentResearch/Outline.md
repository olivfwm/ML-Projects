This is a placeholder for future work with my supervisor on the project of analyzing tango-movments.

**Initial Plan**

After extensive discussions with my supervisor, we carefully selected a research topic that capitalizes on my specific interests in statistical analysis and movement science, while also ensuring that the topic was sufficiently specialized. My plan to earn the three research credits involves a detailed project that integrates the theoretical knowledge I've gained as a statistics major with practical data analysis. The project begins with a comprehensive literature review focused on existing methods for classifying movements using data captured by sensors. This foundational work will guide the subsequent empirical phase of my study.

In the practical component, I will analyze data collected from three sensors attached to a tango dancer. This phase will be crucial for understanding and quantifying the variability of the dancer's movements, even when the same movements are repeated. My statistical expertise will be instrumental in dissecting this variability and ensuring precise data interpretation.

Building on the insights gained from both the literature review and my own data analysis, I will apply and perhaps refine the classification methods discussed in the scholarly articles to effectively identify and categorize different dance movements. This targeted approach ensures that my research not only deepens my understanding of statistical models but also contributes uniquely to the existing body of knowledge, steering clear of generalities and focusing on innovative applications in sensor-based movement classification.
