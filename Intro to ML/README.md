# Stat 416 Intro To ML
This folder contains work particularly for the Introduction to Machine Learning at UW

Everything here is individual work, so all contributions had been made by me.

The course was mainly focused on
- Regression
- Classification
- Deep Learning
- Clustering and Similarity
- Recommender Systems

Here are some of the representative and meaningful work I have done.

## Deep Learning
Background

Different from previous assignments, where we mainly used Scikit-learn packages for machine learning models, in this project,
we were given a chance to explore with the library **PyTorch**. The specific task that we are trying to do is use **neural network**
to do **image classification**.

Learning outcome
- A total of 5 neural nets, with different architectures to compare the performances
- Usage of kernels to create convolutional layers to reduce overfitting, as well as improve efficiency
- Usage of pooling and activation function
- Design our own structure for neural networks to improve accuracy
- Visualize the effects of number of epochs trained, number of layers used, different combination of hyperparameters,
on the performance of the model

Background

In this assignment, we are tasked with developing a predictive model using data from edX online courses offered by Harvard and MIT. 
The goal is to predict whether a student will complete an online course based on their activity patterns. 
We are provided with a training dataset for model development and a test dataset for evaluation. 
This setup mimics real-world machine learning applications where models are trained on available data but ultimately evaluated on unseen data to gauge future performance.

Learning Outcomes
- applying machine learning techniques to solve problems using real-world datasets, enhancing our understanding of how models are built, evaluated, and deployed
- choose our own model that we have learned over the course and trying combinations of different things
- learn to assess the generalization ability of our models
- simulates real-world data science work environments and provides us with a platform to practice and improve our modeling skills
- consider the ethical implications of our predictive models, especially in terms of their impact on different student groups, fostering our ability to engage with the broader societal impacts of machine learning
