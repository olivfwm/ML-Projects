# Statistics Honors Individual Study - Movements Classification and Analysis

This is a placeholder for future work with my supervisor on the project of analyzing tango-movments.

## Initial Plan

After extensive discussions with my supervisor, we carefully selected a research topic that capitalizes on my specific interests in statistical analysis and movement science, while also ensuring that the topic was sufficiently specialized. My plan to earn the three research credits involves a detailed project that integrates the theoretical knowledge I've gained as a statistics major with practical data analysis. The project begins with a comprehensive literature review focused on existing methods for classifying movements using data captured by sensors. This foundational work will guide the subsequent empirical phase of my study.

In the practical component, I will analyze data collected from three sensors attached to a tango dancer. This phase will be crucial for understanding and quantifying the variability of the dancer's movements, even when the same movements are repeated. My statistical expertise will be instrumental in dissecting this variability and ensuring precise data interpretation.

Building on the insights gained from both the literature review and my own data analysis, I will apply and perhaps refine the classification methods discussed in the scholarly articles to effectively identify and categorize different dance movements. This targeted approach ensures that my research not only deepens my understanding of statistical models but also contributes uniquely to the existing body of knowledge, steering clear of generalities and focusing on innovative applications in sensor-based movement classification.


# Washington eXperimental Mathematics Lab

This is the research credit program under the Mathematics department at UW.

I have participated in it for two consecutive quarters.

## Cryptography vs Divination Systems

**Background**

Divination systems, such as Astrology or Tarot, have been used though out human history, in cultures across the whole world. Though they are based in outdated understanding of the universe, rooted in religion and superstition they have remained popular. Astrology is based on the positions of the sun, moons and other planets in our solar system relative to constellations (distant stars), Tarot is like a deck of cards, and the divination technique follows a regular pattern of drawing cards. This can be viewed as analogous to cryptographic pseudorandom number generators, which provide randomness to cryptographic algorithms and protocols, and how they extract randomness from the environment

This project is interested in looking past the unscientific origins of these systems, and instead seek to characterize the system as a deterministic system that takes readings from the environment. Then these algorithms will be analyzed to see if they provide the desired security properties that a cryptographic random number generator does.

### Winter 2024 Focus

Analyze the entropy in the astrological data which is generated randomly to approximate actual data within the population. Study how to make use of this entropy to store data into database, and structure in a way that reduces leakage of birth data. Calculate mutual information between different signs, and visualize their behaviors to show any underlying patterns.

**Materials**

- Final WI-24.pdf
  - poster being presented to the rest of groups as well as other audience containing the work of the entire quarter
- MutualInfo.ipynb
  - my work with analyzing the mutual information and visualizations

### Spring 2024 Focus (in progress)

Conducting machine learning experiments with astrological data to show independence between astrological data, general information, and astrological appsâ€™ results. Trying to find correlation between the behavior of overfitting in models and astroly apps' predictions.

**Materials**

- Final report
  - in progress
- creditModel.ipynb
  - experiment with machine learning models on credit card holders information (anonymous and nothing confidential) and their astrological data
  - the general idea is to fit a good predictive model without astrological data, just general information of each subject, that can be leaked from some other platforms
  - then add in the astrological data to look at how the model's performance alters
  - results so far suggests that astrological does not provide further information in the prediction of some features of the subjects 



### Individual Contributions

- Meeting twice a week to discuss independent work, and further research directions
- Contribute ideas on each others works, as well as my own work
- Provide insights for the team and how my work over the week may or may not help
- Conduct much of the python coding parts, such as data cleaning, writing algorithms, data analysis, visualizations, machine learning with overfitting the data at hand
- Give interpretations of my work and improve based on others suggestions

### Learning Outcomes

This is the main source of my hands-on research experience. If I will be researching with a team or individually in more professional setting in the near future, this experience has really given me some idea of work as a researcher. It also had a huge influence on my communication and idea sharing skills. My team was easy-going and supportive of bring up and exchanging new ideas, which gave me confidence to discuss my ideas, as well as think outside of the box.

It was also a great opportunity to see what the other teams were working on during the final presentation. Some groups really had high-level research topics, so I learn a lot from their speeches and presentation.
