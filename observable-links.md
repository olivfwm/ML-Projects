# Obserable Notebook Links

This file contains links to the major notebooks I did with Observable, an interactive visualization notebook platform. I used it for a lot of my big projects for data visualizations.

For more details on each individual notebook, please visit each link, as they are anticipated to be viewed by the public, and much more well written.

All except the Seattle Trees analysis for CSE 412 was individual work.
