Background

We were provided a few raw datasets from CourseKata, a statistical learning platform, with the performance of the students using this platform. The data included student's self ratings on various aspects, time spent on the pages across different chapters and books, retry attempts, time the student did not interact with the platform, and the EOC, which is some score the student gets after completing the checkpoints.

Our goal was to analyze the student behaviors and provide insights and recommendations to CourseKata, which aims to improve their understandings of how to help students maximize their potential.

Materials
