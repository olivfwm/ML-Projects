Background

We were provided a few raw datasets from CourseKata, a statistical learning platform, with the performance of the students using this platform. The data included student's self ratings on various aspects, time spent on the pages across different chapters and books, retry attempts, time the student did not interact with the platform, and the EOC, which is some score the student gets after completing the checkpoints.

Our goal was to analyze the student behaviors and provide insights and recommendations to CourseKata, which aims to improve their understandings of how to help students maximize their potential.

Materials
- Team report and presentation
- Unsupervised learning notebook by me

Individual Constributions
- Data processing across several dataset such as page_views, EOC, pulse_ratings
- K-means clustering on the data to find hidden patterns of student performance measured by EOC
    - cluster students into 4 main clusters and looked at the spread of their data for some selected columns, such as number of retry attempts, engagement time, off-page duration, etc. These columns were determined according to their correlation with EOC score
- Focused on both all book chapters, as well as specific hard chapters, that were determined by visualizations from my team mates
- Provided recommendations supported by my clustering result

Outcome
- Best Visualization Award for informative data visualizations that provided supported our recommendations made to CourseKata
