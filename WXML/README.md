# Washington eXperimental Mathematics Lab

This is the research credit program under the Mathematics department at UW.

I have participated in it for two consecutive quarters.

## Cryptography vs Divination Systems

**Background**

Divination systems, such as Astrology or Tarot, have been used though out human history, in cultures across the whole world. Though they are based in outdated understanding of the universe, rooted in religion and superstition they have remained popular. Astrology is based on the positions of the sun, moons and other planets in our solar system relative to constellations (distant stars), Tarot is like a deck of cards, and the divination technique follows a regular pattern of drawing cards. This can be viewed as analogous to cryptographic pseudorandom number generators, which provide randomness to cryptographic algorithms and protocols, and how they extract randomness from the environment

**Winter 2024 Focus**

This project is interested in looking past the unscientific origins of these systems, and instead seek to characterize the system as a deterministic system that takes readings from the environment. Then these algorithms will be analyzed to see if they provide the desired security properties that a cryptographic random number generator does.

**Spring 2024 Focus**
This project also provides an opportunity to make graphical representations of the systems involved, such as the mapping of the actual solar system onto the astrological system.
